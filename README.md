Hello! I'm a student at Bronx Science and a big Minecraft player (focused on MCBE redstone and random technical things) who likes to code random things whenever he feels like it (for example, i'm working on something in the topic of AI/ML/Neural Networks)

I'm also @HenryLi-0 's non-school-related account
